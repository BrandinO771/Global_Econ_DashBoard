BY BRANDON STEINKE:

Took the previous group project and made following revisions....

INFO BOXES:
	Pop-up boxes: 
		Upper Right Box
			* now reads in the flag icon properly as image not emoji ascii 
			* cleaned up the data formatting 

		Lower Right Box:
			* cleaned up formatting - now in a table format
			* revised code to tag econ category and country to be highlighted yellow in the list  
				so it is clear which country is being moused over and category is currently selected and displaying map
			* now sorted in a custom way with econ categories grouped by type

		Lower Left Legend:
			* reworked the code so color and values display and calculate correctly in the legend
			* moved position on screen up and right to be more visible
			* category type now displays at top of box

		Upper Left Box : Top 10 
			* new box, challenging to add and remove this object on map redraw
			* used a visible invisible style formatting to only show object container once it was 
				filled with data, without a small gray square would be visible 
			* used d3 to find all these obj boxes with more than 2 rows and delete those old objs once the 
				map was redrawn and new object created, preventing multiple box creation 
			* used new technique to dynamically build this list as a dictionary in python to return to json call so could be sorted
SCREEN :
	Scroll Lock:
		* Found great solution on Stack to lock the map so user could not scroll into blank areas of map and 
			get lost, as there is currently no recenter map button function 
	Media Responsive:
		* implemented CSS media query to shrink scale on slightly smaller pc screen, not sure how this 
			will display on mobile
	UI:
		* Created border at top and bottom of screen to make clear , the title of the page , and the 
			economics selection button
		* Greatly increased size and centered the economics selection button

POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES:
	* Top Ten, user clicks button to scroll forward and back by next ten
	* reverse sort and show bottom ten
